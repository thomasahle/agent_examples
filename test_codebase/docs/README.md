# Test Codebase for LLM Agents

This is a simple Python codebase designed to test LLM agent frameworks. It includes a basic application structure with several Python modules, tests, and TODO comments.

## Project Structure

└── docs/
    └── README.md
```

## Features

The codebase includes:

1. Python modules with various functions and classes
2. Documentation comments and type hints
3. Several TODO comments scattered throughout the code
4. A basic test suite
5. Imports and dependencies between modules

## TODO Items

There are several TODO comments scattered throughout the code that LLM agents can find and analyze:

- Implement logging configuration
- Add error handling for missing configuration
- Implement command line argument parsing
- Create a default config if file doesn't exist
- Implement pretty-printing for console output
- Implement proper schema validation
- Add better error handling and recovery
- Implement data cleaning
- Add data enrichment from external sources
- Add more test cases for edge conditions

## Purpose

This codebase is designed to test agent capabilities such as:

1. Searching for specific patterns (like TODO comments)
2. Understanding code structure and dependencies
3. Analyzing function calls and imports
4. Identifying potential improvements or bugs
