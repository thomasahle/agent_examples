# Test Codebase for Agent Tasks

This is a simple Python project that serves as a test codebase for LLM agent frameworks to analyze and work with. It includes several Python modules with TODOs, functions, and a basic application structure.

## Example Agent Tasks

Here are some example tasks you can ask the agents to perform:

1. **Find all TODO comments in the codebase**
   - Count them and list their locations

2. **Analyze code structure**
   - Identify the main components and their relationships
   - Map out the dependencies between modules

3. **Identify potential bugs or issues**
   - Look for incomplete implementation or error handling

4. **Implement a missing feature**
   - Choose one of the TODOs to implement

5. **Add test cases**
   - Implement tests for parts of the code that aren't well-tested

6. **Suggest refactoring**
   - Identify code that could be improved or refactored

## Running the Code

The code itself is not meant to be run as a fully functional application. It's a skeleton project with intentional TODOs and gaps for agents to work with.

## Using with Agent Frameworks

1. Point your agent at this directory
2. Give it one of the tasks above
3. See how well the agent can navigate, analyze, and modify the codebase
